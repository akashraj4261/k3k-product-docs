= How-to: Expose Workloads Outside the Virtual Cluster
:revdate: 2025-09-10

This guide explains how to expose workloads running in k3k-managed virtual clusters to external networks. Behavior varies depending on the operating mode of the virtual cluster.

== Virtual Mode

[CAUTION]
====
In _virtual mode_, direct external exposure of workloads is *not available*. This mode is designed for strong isolation and does not expose the virtual cluster's network directly.
====

== Shared Mode

In _shared mode_, workloads can be exposed to the external network using standard Kubernetes service types or an ingress controller, depending on your requirements.

[NOTE]
====
_`Services`_ are always synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster following the same principle described link:../architecture.adoc#shared-mode[here] for pods.
====

=== Option 1: Use `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`

To expose a service such as a web application outside the host cluster:

* *`NodePort`*: Exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP. Access the service at `http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
* *`LoadBalancer`*: Provisions an external load balancer (if supported by the environment) and exposes the service via the load balancer's IP.

[NOTE]
====
The `LoadBalancer` IP is currently not reflected back to the virtual cluster service. +

====

=== Option 2: Use `ClusterIP` for Internal Communication

If the workload should only be accessible to other services or pods _within_ the host cluster:

* Use the `ClusterIP` service type. This exposes the service on an internal IP, only reachable inside the host cluster.

=== Option 3: Use Ingress for HTTP/HTTPS Routing

For more advanced routing, such as hostname- or path-based routing, deploy an *Ingress controller* in the virtual cluster, and expose it via `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.

This allows you to:

* Define Ingress resources in the virtual cluster.
* Route external traffic to services within the virtual cluster.

=== Options 4: Use Host Ingress

To use the host ingress controller, enable `sync.ingresses`. Since, ingresses are synced with the host cluster, virtual cluster users don't need to deploy an ingress Controller.

With this sync enabled, certificate can also be issued by the host cluster. For example, certificate can be issued if you're using `Cert-Manager`.
